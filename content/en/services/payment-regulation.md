## What is the EUDI Wallet?
In accordance with the EU regulation 2024/1183, often referred to as “eIDAS 2.0”, all EU member states must provide a European Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet to their citizens by early 2027.

Such a wallet will enable citizens to store digital identification documents in the form of so-called credentials and utilize these for various use cases across the EU. Such use cases include (bank) account opening, payment transaction authorization or SIM Card registration. Learn more about the use cases on the European Commission Website.
